# Features
- Uploading object files via Assimp
- Gamma correction
- Blinn-Phong shading
- Instancing
- Cubemap backgrounds
- Directional, point, and spotlights
- Directional shadows and point light shadows

# What I learned
- How the graphics rendering pipeline works
- Shading methods
- Framebuffers, depth buffers, stencil buffers, and image buffers, along with use cases
- Use of Vertex, Geometry, and Fragment shaders
- Shadow casting using a depth buffer

# Things to Fix
- Error 1282 occurs when rendering
- The scene fails to render when either the point light or directional light doesn't cast a shadow

# Things to Implement
- Make this a library to use for projects
- Normal mapping
- HDR
- Physically based bloom
- PBR
- Ray Tracing
